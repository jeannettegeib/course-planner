<h1>Welcome to Course Planner</h1>

<p>Course Planner is an app that assists learners in self-paced courses to meet a target completion date. The learner selects the date that they would like to have the course completed by, and the app assigns a 'due date' to each individual lesson in the course to keep the learner on track to meet their target. Learners are able to track and visual their progress toward their goal. </p>
